<h3><em>The Moirad, A Song of the Fates and The Trojan War</em></h3>
<p><strong>Book I: The Council of Zeus</strong></p>
<p>In bright Olympus, crowned by heavens high,<br />
The father of gods, great Zeus, in shadows nigh,<br />
Sat on his throne, his brow furrowed by fate,<br />
The world below in balance, poised to break.<br />
Beside him stood wise Themis, just and clear,<br />
Her voice a steady whisper in his ear.<br />
"Now is the time, O King, to strike the flame,<br />
That men may fall and gods will rise in fame."</p>
<p>"For ages past, the race of man has grown,<br />
Their cities vast, their glory brightly shown,<br />
Yet hubris swells, and mortal pride takes hold,<br />
No longer do they heed what fate foretold."<br />
Zeus nodded slow, his storm-lit eyes aglow,<br />
He knew the war must come, its winds must blow.<br />
"For this great war," he spoke, "must cull the land,<br />
To lighten earth from mortals' heavy hand.</p>
<p>Let fire and sword descend upon the plains,<br />
And Troy, that stubborn city, feel the flames."<br />
Thus, Themis bowed and left her king's command,<br />
To stir the threads that fate had planned by hand.<br />
The die was cast, the stage now set for strife,<br />
As gods prepared to intervene in life.</p>
<p><strong>Book II: The Wedding of Peleus</strong></p>
<p>Far from Olympus, on Thessalian shore,<br />
A wedding feast began with joy and lore.<br />
The hero Peleus, chosen by the gods,<br />
Wed Thetis, queen of Nereids, far and broad.<br />
The mortal and divine entwined as one,<br />
As silver waves embraced the golden sun.</p>
<p>The gods descended, bringing gifts of grace,<br />
To honor Peleus and his bride’s embrace.<br />
Apollo’s lyre sang sweet beneath the moon,<br />
And Artemis adorned her hair with bloom.<br />
But one was slighted, Eris, goddess grim,<br />
Whose heart was cold as shadows deep and dim.</p>
<p>Spurned from the feast, she cast a deadly snare,<br />
A golden apple, gleaming bright and fair.<br />
"To the fairest," its simple script declared,<br />
And thus the seeds of discord were prepared.<br />
Three goddesses arose with heated pride—<br />
Queen Hera, and Athena, war's stern guide,</p>
<p>And lovely Aphrodite, love’s soft breath,<br />
Each claimed the prize that led to war and death.<br />
Before the gods, they cried for Zeus' decree,<br />
But wisely he refused this choice to see.<br />
"Let Paris, prince of Troy, decide your fate,<br />
For he shall judge who holds the fairest state."</p>
<p><strong>Book III: The Judgment of Paris</strong></p>
<p>Upon the slopes of Ida’s verdant hill,<br />
The shepherd Paris watched the flocks stand still.<br />
Unknowing, yet a prince of Troy by birth,<br />
He lived in peace, removed from royal mirth.<br />
One day the goddesses appeared in light,<br />
Their forms aglow, a vision pure and bright.<br />
They offered gifts to win his mortal mind,<br />
Each promise steeped in power, strong and kind.</p>
<p>Proud Hera spoke of kingdoms vast and wide,<br />
"All power in the world shall be your guide."<br />
Athena promised wisdom, sharp as spears,<br />
"With me, you’ll conquer lands and quell your fears."<br />
But Aphrodite, smiling soft and sweet,<br />
Offered a prize no mortal could defeat:<br />
"The fairest woman of the earth shall be<br />
Yours to possess in love eternally."</p>
<p>Paris, in youthful folly, chose desire,<br />
And Aphrodite’s prize lit passion's fire.<br />
Thus Helen, wife of Sparta's king renowned,<br />
Would soon be claimed, and mighty Troy unbound.<br />
The seeds of war were sown in golden dust,<br />
As love and lust led men to fate unjust.</p>
<p><strong>Book IV: The Gathering Storm</strong></p>
<p>Now Paris, drawn by fate’s unyielding hand,<br />
Set sail from Troy to reach fair Sparta’s land.<br />
The gods looked on as mortals played their part,<br />
For soon would come the breaking of the heart.<br />
In Menelaus’ halls, his wife so fair,<br />
Did Paris glimpse her beauty, rich and rare.<br />
A spark ignited, kindling through the night,<br />
And Helen’s gaze returned his burning light.</p>
<p>With Aphrodite’s charm, they fled the court,<br />
To Troy’s high walls, her beauty now his fort.<br />
But in their wake, the winds of war did rise,<br />
As Menelaus, wronged, sought vengeance wide.<br />
To mighty Agamemnon, king and peer,<br />
He turned, his brother’s wrath both loud and clear.</p>
<p>"Let all the Greeks unite beneath my hand,<br />
We’ll bring our armies to fair Troy’s proud land.<br />
For Helen’s theft, we’ll strike with sword and spear,<br />
And burn their city down in fire and fear."<br />
Thus, Agamemnon called the banners high,<br />
The kings of Greece prepared their ships to fly.</p>
<p><strong>Book V: The Call to Arms</strong></p>
<p>Across the hills of Greece, the cry rang out,<br />
For kings and warriors to cast off doubt.<br />
From Sparta, Argos, Athens, lands so wide,<br />
The summons spread, and all the Greeks did ride.<br />
With spear and shield, with chariot and flame,<br />
They gathered to the cause of Troy’s famed shame.</p>
<p>Achilles came, with Myrmidonian band,<br />
Patroclus at his side, both brave and grand.<br />
And from the isles, the archer kings set sail,<br />
Odysseus, wily, with his ships pale.<br />
From Ithaca’s fair shores, he heard the call,<br />
Though hearth and home had bound his heart in thrall.</p>
<p>But now his mind was sharp with warlike schemes,<br />
For Troy, he knew, would not fall through dreams.<br />
Diomedes came, the Argive prince of fame,<br />
And Ajax, giant born, with unbowed frame.<br />
The fleet did swell with warriors bright and bold,<br />
Their oars and banners tipped with shining gold.</p>
<p>Thus Agamemnon, king of Mycenae,<br />
Led all the Greeks to war upon the sea.<br />
A thousand ships cut through the silver tide,<br />
Their prows like blades that hewed the ocean wide.<br />
In Aulis’ port they gathered, strong and fierce,<br />
The gods looked down, their will to soon coerce.</p>
<p><strong>Book VI: The Sacrifice to Artemis</strong></p>
<p>Yet winds would not obey the Greeks’ command,<br />
For Artemis held still the sea and land.<br />
Her wrath, a bitter gust, denied their way,<br />
And ships stood stranded for many a day.<br />
In anger rose the sons of Greece’s kings,<br />
For what could halt their force, their sharpened wings?</p>
<p>Then Calchas, seer, his eyes ablaze with sight,<br />
Spoke solemn words beneath the starlit night:<br />
"A price is owed to calm the goddess’ heart,<br />
A sacrifice to tear her wrath apart.<br />
Iphigenia, daughter pure and true,<br />
Must bleed for winds to rise and pass us through."</p>
<p>The men stood still, their eyes upon the king,<br />
For Agamemnon bore the bitter sting.<br />
Yet duty bound, he led his child to fate,<br />
His heart a stone beneath the gods’ great weight.<br />
With trembling hand, the blade did fall and weep,<br />
And winds arose, no longer bound in sleep.</p>
<p>The Greeks set sail, their ships like stars in flight,<br />
Toward Troy’s proud walls, beneath the moon’s cold light.</p>
<p><strong>Book VII: The Greeks Land at Troy</strong></p>
<p>The dawn broke bright as Troy’s shores came in sight,<br />
A golden city bathed in morning’s light.<br />
The Greeks, with fury sharpened in their breast,<br />
Prepared for war, their bodies hard with zest.<br />
The ships did land, their hulls upon the sand,<br />
And soldiers leapt to seize the Trojan land.</p>
<p>The clash of shields, the ringing of the spear,<br />
Announced to Troy that fate was drawing near.<br />
But Hector, noble prince, stood firm in guard,<br />
The walls of Troy would not be breached or marred.<br />
His armor gleamed, his spear was swift as flame,<br />
The Trojans rallied at their hero’s name.</p>
<p>For Paris, too, though cause of war and grief,<br />
Took arms to prove his worth, though all was brief.<br />
The first day saw the Greeks advance with pride,<br />
But Trojans held their ground, their loss denied.<br />
Yet soon the years would stretch, a war unkind,<br />
For both great hosts were equally aligned.</p>
<p><strong>Book VIII: The Failed Embassy to Troy</strong></p>
<p>Though blades of bronze had cleaved the air,<br />
The Greeks, in wisdom, sent an envoy fair.<br />
Odysseus, the wily, wise, and sly,<br />
And Menelaus, Helen’s husband high,<br />
Did cross the field of battle to the gate,<br />
In hopes that peace might come before too late.</p>
<p>Before old Priam’s throne, they made their plea:<br />
“Return fair Helen, set your city free.<br />
This war need not lay waste to time and place,<br />
If Paris yields and gives back Helen’s grace.<br />
Odysseus spoke with words both sharp and clear,<br />
His honeyed tongue meant to dispel all fear.</p>
<p>King Priam, wise of age and grayed with years,<br />
Listened close, his heart tugged by their fears.<br />
Yet Paris, bold, his pride inflamed anew,<br />
Refused to yield, his words both cold and true.<br />
“Not for Greece, nor for their wrathful king,<br />
Shall I give back the prize that love did bring.”</p>
<p>Though Priam’s heart was torn with doubt and pain,<br />
The will of Paris held, and so remained.<br />
With heavy heart, Odysseus turned to go,<br />
His words unheeded, and the seeds of woe.<br />
Thus failed the Greeks’ last bid to halt the fight,<br />
And war would reign beneath both day and night.</p>
<p><strong>Book IX: Renewed Clash Upon the Sands</strong></p>
<p>The Greeks had landed on the Trojan shore,<br />
Their ships drawn up, their oars now still once more.<br />
With bronze-clad warriors marching from the ships,<br />
Their spears and shields in hand, firm on their lips.<br />
The embassy to Priam now had failed,<br />
And war, its flames ignited, had prevailed.</p>
<p>As dawn broke bright upon the bloody sand,<br />
Agamemnon called his captains, firm in hand.<br />
He stood upon the shore, his voice a roar,<br />
“Now, sons of Greece, we break through Troy’s high door.<br />
The time for peace has fled like fading dreams,<br />
Today, the blood of Trojans feeds the streams.”</p>
<p>Beside him stood the heroes, proud and true,<br />
Menelaus, heart burning with a view<br />
Of Helen’s face, still held within the walls,<br />
And Ajax, tall and broad, who heeds no calls<br />
To mercy—only battle fills his sight,<br />
As Greece prepares to face the coming fight.</p>
<p>The armies formed, with shields aligned as one,<br />
Their armor gleaming ‘neath the rising sun.<br />
A hundred thousand strong, they lined the shore,<br />
Their voices raised, a battle hymn, a roar.<br />
And from the gates of Troy came Hector’s host,<br />
With banners flying, each man at his post.</p>
<p>The first to meet them, swift across the plain,<br />
Was Hector, prince of Troy, without disdain.<br />
He led his men with valor in his eyes,<br />
A warrior, where honor never dies.<br />
Behind him came the Trojans, proud and strong,<br />
Their spears in hand, their chariots drawn along.</p>
<p>The battle met in clouds of dust and screams,<br />
As spears were thrust and arrows split the seams.<br />
The clash of shields, the clang of swords on stone,<br />
The earth itself did tremble with a groan.<br />
Hector and Ajax first exchanged their blows,<br />
Two giants clashing, caught as bitter foes.</p>
<p>With spear in hand, great Ajax struck out first,<br />
His strength like mountain winds in sudden burst.<br />
But Hector, swift of foot and sure of hand,<br />
Parried the blow and drove him from the sand.<br />
Their shields collided, bronze on bronze so loud,<br />
The sound like thunder echoed through the crowd.</p>
<p>Men fell like leaves upon the autumn’s gust,<br />
Their lifeblood mingled with the sand and dust.<br />
The Greeks, though fierce, found Troy’s defense was hard,<br />
For Hector’s hand did guard the city’s yard.<br />
Yet still they pressed, with Diomedes’ might,<br />
And Menelaus, eager for the fight.</p>
<p>The chariots raced across the bloodied field,<br />
With spears aloft and swords that none would yield.<br />
Odysseus, though wise in thought and plan,<br />
Took up his spear and slew a mighty man—<br />
A Trojan lord whose name would fade with time,<br />
But then was known as noble in his prime.</p>
<p>And so the battle raged, with blood and tears,<br />
As war’s first song rang loud upon their ears.<br />
The gods above watched from their thrones of gold,<br />
For now the war had truly taken hold.</p>
<p><strong>Book X: The Death of Protesilaus</strong></p>
<p>Among the brave ranks, one stood proud and tall,<br />
Protesilaus, destined to fall.<br />
The first to leap forth from the ships on the sand,<br />
A hero, a warrior, with fate in his hand.<br />
He rushed toward the gates, his heart full of fire,<br />
Determined to face every threat and desire.</p>
<p>But Hector, fierce prince, with a glint in his eye,<br />
Prepared for the duel, where the bold often die.<br />
They clashed with the might of two titans of old,<br />
Spear met with shield, each warrior bold.<br />
But the Fates had decreed that the end was nigh,<br />
And Protesilaus fell, beneath Troy’s dark sky.</p>
<p>The Greeks mourned their hero, their hearts filled with dread,<br />
For the blood of their comrade was a river now fed.<br />
Yet in his brave death, his legend would rise,<br />
A symbol of courage that reached for the skies.<br />
The sound of his fall echoed through every heart,<br />
As the Greeks rallied strong, refusing to part.</p>
<p>Protesilaus’ name would forever resound,<br />
In the tales of the brave, in the legends profound.<br />
For the price of the glory was a bitter toll,<br />
Yet his spirit endured, a flame in the soul.<br />
In the shadows of battle, his courage would shine,<br />
A beacon of hope in the ruins of time.</p>
<p><strong>Book XI: The Sacking of Neighboring Cities</strong></p>
<p>In those first days, when war’s bright fury soared,<br />
The Greeks struck Troy, a tempest forged in swords.<br />
Beneath the sun’s fierce, golden, watching gaze,<br />
They sought to seize the spoils of fire and blaze.<br />
No peace they sought, nor mercy’s fleeting breath,<br />
But glory carved in flame and shadowed death.</p>
<p>Achilles, swift as eagle’s wing in flight,<br />
Led forth his Myrmidons, hearts burning bright.<br />
With shields that gleamed like dawn upon the plain,<br />
They marched through smoke and ash and warlike strain.<br />
The cry of trumpets split the morning air,<br />
And men beheld that doom itself was there.</p>
<p>The walls rose high, yet trembled at his tread,<br />
For wrath of gods seemed in his footsteps spread.<br />
With spear in hand and fury in his breast,<br />
He stormed the gates, by no restraint suppressed.<br />
The clash of bronze resounded through the field,<br />
And all before his might were forced to yield.</p>
<p>King Mynes stood, a lion crowned in pride,<br />
Yet none could turn Achilles from his stride.<br />
Their spears did ring, their shields with thunder sang,<br />
Till death’s cold voice through Lyrnessus rang.<br />
The victor stood amid the crimson rain,<br />
And silence fell upon the heaps of slain.</p>
<p>Lyrnessus burned, its towers a pyre of flame,<br />
Its streets a grave, its ruin now his fame.<br />
Briseis, fair as dawn on ocean’s crest,<br />
Was taken captive, sorrow in her breast.<br />
The Myrmidons, their armor stained with red,<br />
Raised up their cries to honor those now dead.</p>
<p>Through Pedasus next, they carved their bloody way,<br />
And cities fell beneath the light of day.<br />
The cries of dying men filled earth and sky,<br />
Their fates sealed fast where heroes came to die.<br />
Each conquest blazed, each triumph fed the lore,<br />
Of Greece’s wrath that swept from shore to shore.</p>
<p><strong>Book XII: First Assault on the Walls</strong></p>
<p>The siege’s dawn broke fierce and burning red,<br />
The sun, a watchful eye o’er countless dead.<br />
The Greeks, impatient, gathered on the field,<br />
With bronze-clad hearts and shields they would not yield.<br />
They swore by gods that Troy should fall that day,<br />
And rushed to arms to force the walls away.</p>
<p>With spear in hand, great Ajax took the lead,<br />
His frame a tower, born of warlike breed.<br />
Beside him strode brave Diomedes, strong,<br />
Whose blade had sung of valor loud and long.<br />
Their battle cries rolled thunder through the plain,<br />
A roar that shook the towers of Ilium’s reign.</p>
<p>“Now break their gates!” cried Agamemnon’s voice,<br />
“For only in their fall shall we rejoice!<br />
No peace for Troy, whose theft brought shame to Greece—<br />
No rest until her burning brings release!”<br />
Their banners rose, their chariots flashed with flame,<br />
And every heart beat wild with death and fame.</p>
<p>The Trojans watched from battlements of stone,<br />
Their courage steeled, their fear to none made known.<br />
With Hector at their head, both fierce and sure,<br />
They swore their walls and honor to endure.<br />
His voice rang high above the city’s din,<br />
“Hold fast, my sons! Let none of Greece come in!”</p>
<p>Then surged the Greeks, their shields a shining wave,<br />
Each man prepared to conquer or to brave.<br />
Their spears flew high, their arrows dark as night,<br />
The plain became a sea of death and fight.<br />
The gates of Troy shook hard beneath their blows,<br />
As Ajax struck and laid his fearsome foes.</p>
<p>Upon the walls, the archers bent their bows,<br />
A rain of death descending on their foes.<br />
The clang of bronze and cries of dying men<br />
Rose up to heaven and fell to earth again.<br />
Blood darkened soil beneath the midday glare,<br />
And smoke entwined with shouts of war and prayer.</p>
<p>Still Hector stood, unyielding in his might,<br />
His spear a lightning flash, his eyes alight.<br />
Each foe he met fell broken at his feet,<br />
For none could match his fury’s deadly beat.<br />
Around him surged his brothers and his band,<br />
The heart of Troy, the shield of Ilion’s land.</p>
<p>Though Greeks pressed hard and many heroes bled,<br />
The Trojan gates stood firm, the city sped.<br />
The day grew long, and dusk’s soft hand drew near,<br />
As dying embers whispered through the spear.<br />
The weary hosts withdrew as shadows fell,<br />
And left the field where countless heroes dwell.</p>
<p>Thus came and passed the first great storm of war,<br />
The clash of nations, blood from shore to shore.<br />
Though Greece struck hard, Troy’s ramparts would not break—<br />
Her strength endured, her fate not yet to take.<br />
So gods looked down and knew the threads were spun,<br />
The war had only now begun to run.</p>
<p><strong>Book XIII: The Duel of Paris and Menelaus</strong></p>
<p>When dawn’s first light spread gold across the plain,<br />
The weary hosts set down their spears again.<br />
A truce was called, and peace was briefly known,<br />
As kings and princes met before the throne.<br />
For Paris, shamed yet proud, stepped forth to stand,<br />
And offered single combat hand to hand.</p>
<p>“Let none but I atone for Helen’s wrong,”<br />
He cried aloud before the gathered throng.<br />
“Her beauty was my choice, her love my fate—<br />
Let blood decide, and end this long debate.”<br />
Menelaus rose, his heart a blazing brand,<br />
His eyes like fire, his sword already in hand.</p>
<p>They met between the armies, still and vast,<br />
Two lions bound by memory of the past.<br />
The clash of bronze rang loud across the field,<br />
Each blow a vow that neither man would yield.<br />
Their shields were struck, their helms in splinters torn,<br />
And gods looked down on mortals pride-borne.</p>
<p>Athena watched with steady, guiding gaze,<br />
While Aphrodite schemed through smoke and haze.<br />
Each goddess strove to guard her chosen side,<br />
Their rival wills across the sky did ride.<br />
And when the tide of battle turned once more,<br />
The air was filled with echoes of their war.</p>
<p>Then Menelaus struck with deadly might,<br />
His spear a bolt that blazed in morning light.<br />
It pierced the shield, it grazed the Trojan’s hair,<br />
And all the Greeks cried out in triumph there.<br />
But Aphrodite shrouded Paris fast,<br />
And bore him off before the fatal cast.</p>
<p>The Greeks beheld the empty, bloodied ground,<br />
Their shouts of joy now changed to anger’s sound.<br />
For peace was lost, the truce dissolved in flame,<br />
And once again the war consumed its name.<br />
The Trojans, roused by gods’ deceitful will,<br />
Took up their arms, and blood would flow until—</p>
<p>The plains of Ilium ran red once more,<br />
As thunder rolled along the distant shore.<br />
The broken pact lay trampled in the sand,<br />
While Zeus looked on, unmoved, with steady hand.<br />
The Fates resumed their weaving dark and deep,<br />
And Troy and Greece returned to restless sleep.</p>
<p><strong>Book XIV: The Gathering of Allies</strong></p>
<p>As dawn’s first light struck Troy’s beleaguered walls,<br />
Priam stood tall within his marble halls.<br />
The war had dragged through years of blood and sand,<br />
Yet still the Greeks remained upon the strand.<br />
In desperation, messengers had flown,<br />
To seek new allies, cities yet unknown.</p>
<p>From distant lands came lords and kings of might,<br />
To bolster Troy, and turn the endless fight.<br />
Sarpedon, Lycian prince, with shining shield,<br />
Led men with hearts that would not bend or yield.<br />
His father Zeus had sent him to the fray,<br />
For gods and men could not avoid this day.</p>
<p>Beside him marched Glaucus, fierce and proud,<br />
His armor bright, his sword sharp as a cloud.<br />
They pledged their arms to Hector’s cause so true,<br />
And brought with them a host, both strong and new.<br />
The gates of Troy, once burdened by despair,<br />
Now saw a glint of hope within the air.</p>
<p>The Greeks, in turn, called for their allies too,<br />
For war’s grim face turned darker as it grew.<br />
From Crete, from Thessaly, and far and wide,<br />
Came warriors bold, who fought with righteous pride.<br />
The Greeks and Trojans now prepared for war,<br />
With numbers greater than had come before.</p>
<p>Yet even as they stood with allies near,<br />
The Fates wove threads that soon would tear and sear.<br />
For though they gathered strength and men of skill,<br />
The gods above still moved them toward the hill.<br />
The armies, vast and grand, now filled the plain,<br />
Their banners high, as storm clouds promised rain.</p>
<p><strong>Book XV: The Death of Troilus</strong></p>
<p>Beneath the shadowed gates of Troy’s mighty wall,<br />
Young Troilus rode forth, heedless of the call.<br />
A prince of bright beauty, his laughter like gold,<br />
Yet fate had determined, his story was told.</p>
<p>Achilles lay hidden, a lion in wait,<br />
For the moment to strike, the dance of fate.<br />
With the swiftness of Mercury, he charged through the glade,<br />
And found the young prince, with his heart unafraid.</p>
<p>But Troilus, brave still, drew his spear with intent,<br />
And faced the fierce warrior, their fates tightly bent.<br />
Yet Achilles was wrathful, and his spear found its mark,<br />
As the cries of young Troilus faded to dark.</p>
<p>The city held its breath, as they mourned their lost son,<br />
For in his tender years, the hope had begun.<br />
A spirit now claimed by the blood of the brave,<br />
In the annals of history, his memory would wave.</p>
<p>Achilles returned, with the weight of his crime,<br />
A shadow now cast upon the sands of time.<br />
For every victory won bore a cost so severe,<br />
As the tales of the war turned to whispers of fear.</p>
<p><strong>Book XVI: Hector’s Early Battles</strong></p>
<p>As the war grew fierce, Hector stood high,<br />
The pride of Troy, beneath a blood-red sky.<br />
With shield and with spear, he led from the front,<br />
A beacon of hope in the dark of the hunt.<br />
In the early battles, his courage ablaze,<br />
He fought for his kin, through the smoke and the haze.</p>
<p>The Greek lines surged, with Menelaus in rage,<br />
But Hector held firm, like a lion uncaged.<br />
“Back, Greeks!” he would shout, as he pierced through their ranks,<br />
With a heart full of valor, and unyielding thanks.<br />
For the land he defended, for family’s plea,<br />
He battled like Ares, fierce, wild, and free.</p>
<p>In the clash of the swords, he turned death into art,<br />
As spears flew like arrows, and tore worlds apart.<br />
Each day was a struggle, each victory sweet,<br />
For the walls of Troy rose, like a guardian beat.<br />
Yet in every triumph, he sensed the dark hand,<br />
Of fate’s cruel design, like a thief on the sand.</p>
<p>For the gods played their games, and Hector could see,<br />
That the tides of the war would not always be free.<br />
With honor and valor, he fought through the night,<br />
Yet shadows were closing, and soon came the light.<br />
As the dawn broke anew, and the battle was nigh,<br />
He faced his own fate, with a tear in his eye.</p>
<p><strong>Book XVII: The Building of the Greek Fortifications</strong></p>
<p>The Greeks, though strong in battle, saw their need,<br />
To fortify their camp against Troy’s greed.<br />
They built great walls of stone and trench of dirt,<br />
A shield against the Trojan forces’ hurt.<br />
By night and day, they worked with hardened hand,<br />
To raise a wall that stretched across the land.</p>
<p>The gods above watched on with furrowed brow,<br />
For walls of mortals mocked their sacred vow.<br />
Poseidon, lord of seas, was wroth and fierce,<br />
For mortals dared his earth with tools to pierce.<br />
He swore that once the war had reached its end,<br />
He’d level all they built, and none would bend.</p>
<p>But for a time, the walls gave Greeks their strength,<br />
And held at bay the Trojans’ might at length.<br />
The trench they dug, a moat to hold the foes,<br />
Would soon be filled with blood as battle rose.<br />
And so the war became a siege of stone,<br />
Where neither side could claim the city’s throne.</p>
<p><strong>Book XVIII: The Years of Siege</strong></p>
<p>For eight long years, the war did rage and wind,<br />
With neither side in victory inclined.<br />
The Greeks, though strong, could not breach Trojan walls,<br />
And thus the war became a game of brawls.<br />
By day they fought, by night they buried dead,<br />
Both Greeks and Trojans mourned their fallen head.</p>
<p>The gods themselves took sides in mortal strife,<br />
Each backing heroes with immortal life.<br />
Athena guided Greeks with wisdom bright,<br />
While Ares stirred the Trojans to the fight.<br />
Apollo’s arrows fell like burning rain,<br />
Upon the Greeks, inflicting bitter pain.</p>
<p>But through these years, Achilles stood supreme,<br />
A force of nature, swift as running stream.<br />
His spear laid waste to countless Trojan men,<br />
And Hector feared no other warrior then.<br />
Yet bitterness began to brew inside,<br />
For Agamemnon, king of swollen pride,<br />
Would claim Achilles’ spoils without remorse,<br />
And tensions grew as war took further course.</p>
<p><strong>Book XIX: Achilles’ Exploits and Conquests</strong></p>
<p>Across the plains where the shadows loom,<br />
Achilles marched forth, a harbinger of doom.<br />
His name whispered low, a fearsome refrain,<br />
For in every skirmish, he carved out his reign.</p>
<p>From Phrygia’s hills to Cilicia’s wide shore,<br />
He hunted the Trojans, a lionous roar.<br />
With spear poised high and a heart made of flame,<br />
He turned every foe into whispers of shame.</p>
<p>Cycnus, son of Poseidon, proud and divine,<br />
Challenged Achilles in battle’s cruel design.<br />
Yet the swift-footed warrior, cunning and bold,<br />
With a rock he struck true, his story retold.</p>
<p>In Thebes and in Lyrnessus, his victories bloomed,<br />
With each city fallen, the Greek glory resumed.<br />
But in the depths of his heart, a shadow did grow,<br />
For war’s bitter toll was a weight he would know.</p>
<p>Yet through the darkness, he claimed his fair prize,<br />
The beauty of Briseis, like stars in the skies.<br />
The tales of his deeds echoed through every hall,<br />
For Achilles, the mightiest, would not fear the fall.</p>
<p><strong>Book XX: The Quarrel Begins</strong></p>
<p>At last, the Greeks took Chryseis as a prize,<br />
A maiden claimed beneath the Trojans’ eyes.<br />
Yet soon Apollo’s wrath was stirred to flame,<br />
For Chryses, her father, called upon his name.<br />
The god sent plague upon the Greeks that spread,<br />
And warriors fell by hundreds, sick and dead.<br />
Agamemnon, stubborn, slow to heed,<br />
Refused the plea to let the captive freed.<br />
At last the Greeks, led by Achilles' voice,<br />
Demanded he return her as their choice.</p>
<p>With scornful gaze, the Mycenaean king,<br />
Relented, but his pride cut deep its sting.<br />
"Since I must lose the girl to please the gods,<br />
I’ll take Briseis from Achilles' sods."<br />
Achilles’ face grew dark with rage untold,<br />
His honor struck, his pride grown fierce and bold.<br />
"You dare to take what I have rightly earned?<br />
Then all my might from war shall be adjourned!"</p>
<p>He left the camp, his Myrmidons in tow,<br />
Refusing now to let his anger go.<br />
Without Achilles, Greece would feel the cost,<br />
As war turned dark and hope seemed all but lost.</p>
<p><strong>Book XXI: The Greek's Struggles Without Achilles</strong></p>
<p>Now, leaderless, the Greeks fell back in fear,<br />
For Hector’s force pressed hard with spear and gear.<br />
The Trojans surged with strength renewed by pride,<br />
And many Greeks, their strength and will, denied.<br />
Agamemnon called his forces to stand,<br />
But Achilles’ absence left them weak and fanned.<br />
Odysseus and Ajax fought in vain,<br />
To hold the line, to stem the Trojan gain.</p>
<p>Patroclus, friend of Achilles, gazed in grief,<br />
He knew the Greeks had lost their greatest chief.<br />
Yet still he sought to mend the wound of pride,<br />
To bring Achilles back to Greece’s side.<br />
But all the while, Achilles sat withdrawn,<br />
His wrath unyielding as the breaking dawn.</p>
<p>The Trojan tide rose higher day by day,<br />
The Greek ships now in danger of dismay.<br />
Would Achilles return before the Greeks fell?<br />
Only fate and time had yet more to tell.</p>
<p><strong>Book XXII: The Contest for Achilles’ Glory</strong></p>
<p>In days of quiet, when the war did rest,<br />
The Greeks held contests, feats to prove the best.<br />
Though battles raged and men fell thick and fast,<br />
They sought to claim the glory of the past.<br />
Among them, warriors strong and bold would vie,<br />
To wear Achilles’ fame and touch the sky.</p>
<p>Ajax, tall as mountain, wide as sea,<br />
Declared, “There’s none as strong in arms as me.<br />
Without Achilles, I shall lead our charge,<br />
And wield the strength of gods both swift and large.”<br />
But Diomedes, fierce with fire’s gaze,<br />
Stepped forth and challenged Ajax to the blaze.</p>
<p>With spears and shields, the two men clashed as one,<br />
Beneath the watching gaze of every son.<br />
Their strikes were fierce, their shields like stars of light,<br />
As both men fought to prove their noble might.<br />
But though their hearts were full of warrior’s pride,<br />
The gods above refused to let them bide.</p>
<p>For though they fought, Achilles still remained,<br />
A shadow over all the glory gained.<br />
And so, though strength and courage they did show,<br />
No man could take Achilles’ place below.<br />
The contest, fierce and bold, had shown its strain,<br />
But none could win his fame upon the plain.</p>
<p><strong>Book XXIII: The Siege on the Beach</strong></p>
<p>The Trojans, fierce with courage newly fed,<br />
Now pressed upon the Greeks, who filled with dread.<br />
The sands of Ilium echoed with the sound,<br />
Of battle fierce as day turned slowly round.<br />
Upon the beach where Greek ships lined the shore,<br />
The Trojans sought to burn and win the war.</p>
<p>With Hector at the head, they pushed with might,<br />
And drove the Greeks before them in their flight.<br />
The ships, once proud, now vulnerable and weak,<br />
Became the target for the Trojans' streak.<br />
The Greeks, without Achilles’ wrathful sword,<br />
Fell back, their hope in danger of being floored.</p>
<p>Great Hector struck with fury, fierce and wide,<br />
His spear the harbinger of Troyan pride.<br />
The flames they sought to light upon the mast,<br />
Would signal Troy’s revenge for years now past.<br />
Yet Ajax stood, his shield a wall of force,<br />
To guard the ships from Hector’s mighty course.</p>
<p>His voice a beacon to the Greek’s despair,<br />
“Hold fast!” he cried, “Do not let Hector dare!<br />
For if our ships should burn, then all is lost,<br />
And all our years of war shall bear the cost.”<br />
His words, though strong, could barely stem the tide,<br />
For Hector’s strength grew greater still with pride.</p>
<p>The gods above watched on with stern concern,<br />
For neither side could claim the war’s full turn.<br />
Thus war raged on, with neither side ahead,<br />
And Ilium stood tall, though rivers bled.</p>
<p><strong>Book XXIV: Achilles Withdraws</strong></p>
<p>While Greeks and Trojans fought with savage will,<br />
Achilles sat apart, his heart grown still.<br />
The rage within him simmered, hard and cold,<br />
For Agamemnon’s slight had broken bold.<br />
Though Greeks were pressed, though ships were set aflame,<br />
Achilles would not rise, his pride the same.</p>
<p>Patroclus stood beside him, full of grief,<br />
And begged his friend to lend the Greeks relief.<br />
But Achilles, wrathful, held his sword at bay,<br />
For honor’s loss had turned his heart to clay.<br />
“I will not fight for Agamemnon’s gain,<br />
Let them fall, and Troy’s fires burn the plain.”</p>
<p>Thus while the Greeks were driven to their knees,<br />
Achilles brooded, deaf to all their pleas.<br />
The war dragged on, each battle fierce and long,<br />
But without Achilles, hope seemed weak and wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Book XXV: The Fracturing of Greek Unity</strong></p>
<p>As years passed on, the Greeks began to break,<br />
For war’s long course had bent their will to ache.<br />
Achilles, though a force of wrathful pride,<br />
Had left their cause, his heart no longer tied.<br />
And so the Greeks, without their strongest hand,<br />
Did falter in the harsh and foreign land.</p>
<p>Agamemnon, king, though wise in lead,<br />
Had often clashed with men whose hearts did bleed.<br />
Odysseus, ever calm and full of thought,<br />
Now questioned if their fight was all for naught.<br />
“Why must we linger here upon these shores,<br />
When Troy’s high walls refuse to yield our wars?”</p>
<p>Yet others, fierce in battle’s raging heat,<br />
Would not admit defeat, nor think retreat.<br />
Menelaus, still driven by his grief,<br />
Urged all to fight and bring Troy’s quick relief.<br />
But without Achilles, strife within them grew,<br />
And cracks appeared where once their hearts were true.</p>
<p>The war itself was tearing them apart,<br />
And Greek unity was a fragile heart.</p>
<p><strong>Epilogue: The Loom of Fate</strong></p>
<p>From high Olympus’ peaks the thunder rolled,<br />
And Zeus beheld what mortal hearts had told.<br />
The war he willed now smoldered in its prime,<br />
Its end unseen, yet written deep in time.<br />
The Fates, their shuttles weaving slow and sure,<br />
Prepared the thread of wrath the world must endure.</p>
<p>For soon would rise the song the Muses keep—<br />
Of rage, of loss, of kings who sow and reap.<br />
But for this tale, the threads are bound complete,<br />
The gods withdraw, the mortal pulse grows sweet.<br />
The sea winds sigh, the fires of Troy still burn,<br />
And to the Iliad’s dawn the ages turn.</p>

### *The Moirad, Song of the Fates and The Trojan War*

**Book I: The Council of Zeus**

In bright Olympus, crowned by heavens high,  
The father of gods, great Zeus, in shadows deep,  
Sat on his throne, his brow furrowed by fate,  
The world below in balance, poised to break.  
Beside him stood wise Themis, just and clear,  
Her voice a steady whisper in his ear.  
"Now is the time, O King, to strike the flame,  
That men may fall and gods will rise in fame."

"For ages past, the race of man has grown,  
Their cities vast, their glory brightly shown,  
Yet hubris swells, and mortal pride takes hold,  
No longer do they heed what fate foretold."  
Zeus nodded slow, his storm-lit eyes aglow,  
He knew the war must come, its winds must blow.  
"For this great war," he spoke, "must cull the land,  
To lighten earth from mortals' heavy hand.

Let fire and sword descend upon the plains,  
And Troy, that stubborn city, feel the flames."  
Thus, Themis bowed and left her king's command,  
To stir the threads that fate had planned by hand.  
The die was cast, the stage now set for strife,  
As gods prepared to intervene in life.

**Book II: The Wedding of Peleus**

Far from Olympus, on Thessalian shore,  
A wedding feast began with joy and lore.  
The hero Peleus, chosen by the gods,  
Wed Thetis, queen of Nereids, far and broad.  
The mortal and divine entwined as one,  
As silver waves embraced the golden sun.  
The gods descended, bringing gifts of grace,  
To honor Peleus and his bride’s embrace.

Apollo’s lyre sang sweet beneath the moon,  
And Artemis adorned her hair with bloom.  
But one was slighted, Eris, goddess grim,  
Whose heart was cold as shadows deep and dim.  
Spurned from the feast, she cast a deadly snare,  
A golden apple, gleaming bright and fair.  
"To the fairest," its simple script declared,  
And thus the seeds of discord were prepared.

Three goddesses arose with heated pride—  
Queen Hera, and Athena, war's stern guide,  
And lovely Aphrodite, love’s soft breath,  
Each claimed the prize that led to war and death.  
Before the gods, they cried for Zeus' decree,  
But wisely he refused this choice to see.  
"Let Paris, prince of Troy, decide your fate,  
For he shall judge who holds the fairest state."

**Book III: The Judgment of Paris**

Upon the slopes of Ida’s verdant hill,  
The shepherd Paris watched the flocks stand still.  
Unknowing, yet a prince of Troy by birth,  
He lived in peace, removed from royal mirth.  
One day the goddesses appeared in light,  
Their forms aglow, a vision pure and bright.  
They offered gifts to win his mortal mind,  
Each promise steeped in power, strong and kind.

Proud Hera spoke of kingdoms vast and wide,  
"All power in the world shall be your guide."  
Athena promised wisdom, sharp as spears,  
"With me, you’ll conquer lands and quell your fears."  
But Aphrodite, smiling soft and sweet,  
Offered a prize no mortal could defeat:  
"The fairest woman of the earth shall be  
Yours to possess in love eternally."

Paris, in youthful folly, chose desire,  
And Aphrodite’s prize lit passion's fire.  
Thus Helen, wife of Sparta's king renowned,  
Would soon be claimed, and mighty Troy unbound.  
The seeds of war were sown in golden dust,  
As love and lust led men to fate unjust.

**Book IV: The Gathering Storm**

Now Paris, drawn by fate’s unyielding hand,  
Set sail from Troy to reach fair Sparta’s land.  
The gods looked on as mortals played their part,  
For soon would come the breaking of the heart.  
In Menelaus’ halls, his wife so fair,  
Did Paris glimpse her beauty, rich and rare.  
A spark ignited, kindling through the night,  
And Helen’s gaze returned his burning light.

With Aphrodite’s charm, they fled the court,  
To Troy’s high walls, her beauty now his fort.  
But in their wake, the winds of war did rise,  
As Menelaus, wronged, sought vengeance wide.  
To mighty Agamemnon, king and peer,  
He turned, his brother’s wrath both loud and clear.

"Let all the Greeks unite beneath my hand,  
We’ll bring our armies to fair Troy’s proud land.  
For Helen’s theft, we’ll strike with sword and spear,  
And burn their city down in fire and fear."  
Thus, Agamemnon called the banners high,  
The kings of Greece prepared their ships to fly.

**Book V: The Call to Arms**

Across the hills of Greece, the cry rang out,  
For kings and warriors to cast off doubt.  
From Sparta, Argos, Athens, lands so wide,  
The summons spread, and all the Greeks did ride.  
With spear and shield, with chariot and flame,  
They gathered to the cause of Troy’s famed shame.  
Achilles came, with Myrmidonian band,  
Patroclus at his side, both brave and grand.  
And from the isles, the archer kings set sail,  
Odysseus, wily, with his ships pale.

From Ithaca’s fair shores, he heard the call,  
Though hearth and home had bound his heart in thrall.  
But now his mind was sharp with warlike schemes,  
For Troy, he knew, would not fall through dreams.  
Diomedes came, the Argive prince of fame,  
And Ajax, giant born, with unbowed frame.  
The fleet did swell with warriors bright and bold,  
Their oars and banners tipped with shining gold.

Thus Agamemnon, king of Mycenae,  
Led all the Greeks to war upon the sea.  
A thousand ships cut through the silver tide,  
Their prows like blades that hewed the ocean wide.  
In Aulis’ port they gathered, strong and fierce,  
The gods looked down, their will to soon coerce.

**Book VI: The Sacrifice to Artemis**

Yet winds would not obey the Greeks’ command,  
For Artemis held still the sea and land.  
Her wrath, a bitter gust, denied their way,  
And ships stood stranded for many a day.  
In anger rose the sons of Greece’s kings,  
For what could halt their force, their sharpened wings?

Then Calchas, seer, his eyes ablaze with sight,  
Spoke solemn words beneath the starlit night:  
"A price is owed to calm the goddess’ heart,  
A sacrifice to tear her wrath apart.  
Iphigenia, daughter pure and true,  
Must bleed for winds to rise and pass us through."

The men stood still, their eyes upon the king,  
For Agamemnon bore the bitter sting.  
Yet duty bound, he led his child to fate,  
His heart a stone beneath the gods’ great weight.  
With trembling hand, the blade did fall and weep,  
And winds arose, no longer bound in sleep.

The Greeks set sail, their ships like stars in flight,  
Toward Troy’s proud walls, beneath the moon’s cold light.

### Book VII: The Greeks Land at Troy**

The dawn broke bright as Troy’s shores came in sight,  
A golden city bathed in morning’s light.  
The Greeks, with fury sharpened in their breast,  
Prepared for war, their bodies hard with zest.  
The ships did land, their hulls upon the sand,  
And soldiers leapt to seize the Trojan land.

The clash of shields, the ringing of the spear,  
Announced to Troy that fate was drawing near.  
But Hector, noble prince, stood firm in guard,  
The walls of Troy would not be breached or marred.  
His armor gleamed, his spear was swift as flame,  
The Trojans rallied at their hero’s name.  
For Paris, too, though cause of war and grief,  
Took arms to prove his worth, though all was brief.

The first day saw the Greeks advance with pride,  
But Trojans held their ground, their loss denied.  
Yet soon the years would stretch, a war unkind,  
For both great hosts were equally aligned.

**Book VIII: The Failed Embassy to Troy**

Though blades of bronze had cleaved the air,  
The Greeks, in wisdom, sent an envoy fair.  
Odysseus, the wily, wise, and sly,  
And Menelaus, Helen’s husband high,  
Did cross the field of battle to the gate,  
In hopes that peace might come before too late.

Before old Priam’s throne, they made their plea:  
“Return fair Helen, set your city free.  
This war need not lay waste to time and place,
If Paris yields and gives back Helen’s grace.
Odysseus spoke with words both sharp and clear,  
His honeyed tongue meant to dispel all fear.

King Priam, wise of age and grayed with years,  
Listened close, his heart tugged by their fears.  
Yet Paris, bold, his pride inflamed anew,  
Refused to yield, his words both cold and true.  
“Not for Greece, nor for their wrathful king,  
Shall I give back the prize that love did bring.”

Though Priam’s heart was torn with doubt and pain,  
The will of Paris held, and so remained.  
With heavy heart, Odysseus turned to go,  
His words unheeded, and the seeds of woe.  
Thus failed the Greeks’ last bid to halt the fight,  
And war would reign beneath both day and night.

**Book IX: Renewed Clash Upon the Sands

The Greeks had landed on the Trojan shore,
Their ships drawn up, their oars now still once more.
With bronze-clad warriors marching from the ships,
Their spears and shields in hand, firm on their lips.
The embassy to Priam now had failed,
And war, its flames ignited, had prevailed.

As dawn broke bright upon the bloody sand,
Agamemnon called his captains, firm in hand.
He stood upon the shore, his voice a roar,
“Now, sons of Greece, we break through Troy’s high door.
The time for peace has fled like fading dreams,
Today, the blood of Trojans feeds the streams.”

Beside him stood the heroes, proud and true,
Menelaus, heart burning with a view
Of Helen’s face, still held within the walls,
And Ajax, tall and broad, who heeds no calls
To mercy—only battle fills his sight,
As Greece prepares to face the coming fight.

The armies formed, with shields aligned as one,
Their armor gleaming ‘neath the rising sun.
A hundred thousand strong, they lined the shore,
Their voices raised, a battle hymn, a roar.
And from the gates of Troy came Hector’s host,
With banners flying, each man at his post.

The first to meet them, swift across the plain,
Was Hector, prince of Troy, without disdain.
He led his men with valor in his eyes,
A warrior, where honor never dies.
Behind him came the Trojans, proud and strong,
Their spears in hand, their chariots drawn along.

The battle met in clouds of dust and screams,
As spears were thrust and arrows split the seams.
The clash of shields, the clang of swords on stone,
The earth itself did tremble with a groan.
Hector and Ajax first exchanged their blows,
Two giants clashing, caught as bitter foes.

With spear in hand, great Ajax struck out first,
His strength like mountain winds in sudden burst.
But Hector, swift of foot and sure of hand,
Parried the blow and drove him from the sand.
Their shields collided, bronze on bronze so loud,
The sound like thunder echoed through the crowd.

Men fell like leaves upon the autumn’s gust,
Their lifeblood mingled with the sand and dust.
The Greeks, though fierce, found Troy’s defense was hard,
For Hector’s hand did guard the city’s yard.
Yet still they pressed, with Diomedes’ might,
And Menelaus, eager for the fight.

The chariots raced across the bloodied field,
With spears aloft and swords that none would yield.
Odysseus, though wise in thought and plan,
Took up his spear and slew a mighty man—
A Trojan lord whose name would fade with time,
But then was known as noble in his prime.

And so the battle raged, with blood and tears,
As war’s first song rang loud upon their ears.
The gods above watched from their thrones of gold,
For now the war had truly taken hold.

**Book X: The Death of Protesilaus

Among the brave ranks, one stood proud and tall,  
Protesilaus, destined to fall.  
The first to leap forth from the ships on the sand,  
A hero, a warrior, with fate in his hand.  
He rushed toward the gates, his heart full of fire,  
Determined to face every threat and desire.

But Hector, fierce prince, with a glint in his eye,  
Prepared for the duel, where the bold often die.  
They clashed with the might of two titans of old,  
Spear met with shield, each warrior bold.  
But the Fates had decreed that the end was nigh,  
And Protesilaus fell, beneath Troy’s dark sky.

The Greeks mourned their hero, their hearts filled with dread,  
For the blood of their comrade was a river now fed.  
Yet in his brave death, his legend would rise,  
A symbol of courage that reached for the skies.  
The sound of his fall echoed through every heart,  
As the Greeks rallied strong, refusing to part.

Protesilaus’ name would forever resound,  
In the tales of the brave, in the legends profound.  
For the price of the glory was a bitter toll,  
Yet his spirit endured, a flame in the soul.  
In the shadows of battle, his courage would shine,  
A beacon of hope in the ruins of time.

**Book XI: The Sacking of Neighboring Cities

In those first days, when war’s bright fury soared,
The Greeks struck Troy, a tempest forged in swords.
Beneath the sun’s fierce, golden gaze,  
They sought to seize the prize, the spoils of their blaze.

Achilles, swift as the eagle’s flight,  
Led forth his Myrmidons, hearts burning bright.  
With shields that gleamed like the morning sun,  
They marched toward Lyrnessus, their fates begun.

The walls rose high, but trembled in fear,  
For the wrath of Achilles drew ever near.  
With spear in hand and rage in his chest,  
He dashed through the gates, an unyielding quest.

King Mynes stood tall, a lion in pride,  
But Achilles, relentless, would not be denied.  
With a mighty thrust, his spear found its mark,  
And the echoes of death rang clear in the dark.

Lyrnessus fell, a blaze in the night,  
As flames licked the walls, a terrible sight.  
Briseis was taken, a prize of his fight,  
While the Myrmidons cheered, their spirits alight.

Through Pedasus next, they cut their swift path,  
The cries of the fallen igniting their wrath.  
With every step, the glory grew bright,  
As the Greek forces claimed victory by night.

**Book XII: First Assault on the Walls**

The siege’s dawn broke fierce and burning red, 
The sun, a watchful eye o’er countless dead.  
The Greeks, impatient, pressed against the gate,  
Determined now to break Troy’s fateful state.  
With spear in hand, the mighty Ajax rose,  
His towering frame a shield against his foes.  
Beside him charged brave Diomedes, fierce,  
Whose blade and spear were sharp enough to pierce.

A call to arms spread wide through Greece's camp,  
Their leaders now with eyes of fire and damp.  
“We break their walls!” cried Agamemnon's voice,  
“For only in their fall do we rejoice!”  
The Trojans, high on battlements and towers,  
Prepared for yet another test of powers.

Then rushed the Greeks, their war cries like a wave,  
Determined all to seek either death or save.  
With shields like polished bronze, they stormed the field,  
Their swords and spears aloft, their fates unsealed.  
The gates of Troy shook hard beneath the blow,  
As Ajax struck and laid the foe below.

Upon the battlements, the archers drew,  
A rain of arrows swift and black that flew.  
The Greeks fell hard beneath the sharp refrain,  
But still they pressed with numbers vast and main.  
At last, they neared the walls of stone so bright,  
But Hector stood, the Trojans’ strongest might.

With shield and sword, he barred their way,  
His eyes like flames, his heart like tempered clay.  
Each foe he felled with spear and slash of sword,  
His breath a gale, his strength in waves outpoured.  
Around him rallied Trojan men in throngs,  
Their voices raised in hymns of ancient songs.

For though the Greeks were strong, their courage wide,  
Troy’s walls remained, their entrance still denied.  
The battle raged until the night’s embrace,  
When weary soldiers found their resting place.  
And thus, the first great storm upon the gate,  
Had come and gone, leaving Troy to fate.

**Book XIII: The Duel of Paris and Menelaus

When dawn kissed the hills and the banners unfurled,  
The truce was proposed, and hope was unfurled.  
For Paris, the prince, with a heart full of shame,  
Offered his life for the loss of his name.  
Menelaus, the king, stood proud at his side,  
His heart burning fiercely, with love as his guide.

They met on the field, like two stars in the night,  
With swords drawn and ready, prepared for the fight.  
The clang of their steel rang out like a song,  
As the fate of their nations rested on strong.  
But Paris, though clever, lacked courage this day,  
As Menelaus struck true, sending him away.

The spear pierced the air, but the goddess did swoop,  
And whisked Paris away from the vengeful king’s loop.  
The truce was now shattered, the bloodlust returned,  
And the fires of battle in every heart burned.  
For the duel had proved that not all would be still,  
As the war stretched on, driven by fate’s cruel will.

**Book XIV: The Gathering of Allies**

As dawn’s first light struck Troy’s beleaguered walls,  
Priam stood tall within his marble halls.  
The war had dragged through years of blood and sand,  
Yet still the Greeks remained upon the strand.  
In desperation, messengers had flown,  
To seek new allies, cities yet unknown.

From distant lands came lords and kings of might,  
To bolster Troy, and turn the endless fight.  
Sarpedon, Lycian prince, with shining shield,  
Led men with hearts that would not bend or yield.  
His father Zeus had sent him to the fray,  
For gods and men could not avoid this day.

Beside him marched Glaucus, fierce and proud,  
His armor bright, his sword sharp as a cloud.  
They pledged their arms to Hector’s cause so true,  
And brought with them a host, both strong and new.  
The gates of Troy, once burdened by despair,  
Now saw a glint of hope within the air.

The Greeks, in turn, called for their allies too,  
For war’s grim face turned darker as it grew.  
From Crete, from Thessaly, and far and wide,  
Came warriors bold, who fought with righteous pride.  
The Greeks and Trojans now prepared for war,  
With numbers greater than had come before.

Yet even as they stood with allies near,  
The Fates wove threads that soon would tear and sear.  
For though they gathered strength and men of skill,  
The gods above still moved them toward the hill.  
The armies, vast and grand, now filled the plain,  
Their banners high, as storm clouds promised rain.

**Book XV: The Death of Troilus**

Beneath the shadowed gates of Troy’s mighty wall,  
Young Troilus rode forth, heedless of the call.  
A prince of bright beauty, his laughter like gold,  
Yet fate had determined, his story was told.

Achilles lay hidden, a lion in wait,  
For the moment to strike, the dance of fate.  
With the swiftness of Mercury, he charged through the glade,  
And found the young prince, with his heart unafraid.

But Troilus, brave still, drew his spear with intent,  
And faced the fierce warrior, their fates tightly bent.  
Yet Achilles was wrathful, and his spear found its mark,  
As the cries of young Troilus faded to dark.

The city held its breath, as they mourned their lost son,  
For in his tender years, the hope had begun.  
A spirit now claimed by the blood of the brave,  
In the annals of history, his memory would wave.

Achilles returned, with the weight of his crime,  
A shadow now cast upon the sands of time.  
For every victory won bore a cost so severe,  
As the tales of the war turned to whispers of fear.

**Book XVI: Hector’s Early Battles**

As the war grew fierce, Hector stood high,  
The pride of Troy, beneath a blood-red sky.  
With shield and with spear, he led from the front,  
A beacon of hope in the dark of the hunt.  
In the early battles, his courage ablaze,  
He fought for his kin, through the smoke and the haze.

The Greek lines surged, with Menelaus in rage,  
But Hector held firm, like a lion uncaged.  
“Back, Greeks!” he would shout, as he pierced through their ranks,  
With a heart full of valor, and unyielding thanks.  
For the land he defended, for family’s plea,  
He battled like Ares, fierce, wild, and free.

In the clash of the swords, he turned death into art,  
As spears flew like arrows, and tore worlds apart.  
Each day was a struggle, each victory sweet,  
For the walls of Troy rose, like a guardian beat.  
Yet in every triumph, he sensed the dark hand,  
Of fate’s cruel design, like a thief on the sand.

For the gods played their games, and Hector could see,  
That the tides of the war would not always be free.  
With honor and valor, he fought through the night,  
Yet shadows were closing, and soon came the light.  
As the dawn broke anew, and the battle was nigh,  
He faced his own fate, with a tear in his eye.

**Book XVII: The Building of the Greek Fortifications**

The Greeks, though strong in battle, saw their need,  
To fortify their camp against Troy’s greed.  
They built great walls of stone and trench of dirt,  
A shield against the Trojan forces’ hurt.  
By night and day, they worked with hardened hand,  
To raise a wall that stretched across the land.

The gods above watched on with furrowed brow,  
For walls of mortals mocked their sacred vow.  
Poseidon, lord of seas, was wroth and fierce,  
For mortals dared his earth with tools to pierce.  
He swore that once the war had reached its end,  
He’d level all they built, and none would bend.

But for a time, the walls gave Greeks their strength,  
And held at bay the Trojans’ might at length.  
The trench they dug, a moat to hold the foes,  
Would soon be filled with blood as battle rose.  
And so the war became a siege of stone,  
Where neither side could claim the city’s throne.

**Book XVIII: The Years of Siege**

For eight long years, the war did rage and wind,  
With neither side in victory inclined.  
The Greeks, though strong, could not breach Trojan walls,  
And thus the war became a game of brawls.  
By day they fought, by night they buried dead,  
Both Greeks and Trojans mourned their fallen head.

The gods themselves took sides in mortal strife,  
Each backing heroes with immortal life.  
Athena guided Greeks with wisdom bright,  
While Ares stirred the Trojans to the fight.  
Apollo’s arrows fell like burning rain,  
Upon the Greeks, inflicting bitter pain.

But through these years, Achilles stood supreme,  
A force of nature, swift as running stream.  
His spear laid waste to countless Trojan men,  
And Hector feared no other warrior then.  
Yet bitterness began to brew inside,  
For Agamemnon, king of swollen pride,  
Would claim Achilles’ spoils without remorse,  
And tensions grew as war took further course.

**Book XIX: Achilles’ Exploits and Conquests

Across the plains where the shadows loom,  
Achilles marched forth, a harbinger of doom.  
His name whispered low, a fearsome refrain,  
For in every skirmish, he carved out his reign.

From Phrygia’s hills to Cilicia’s wide shore,  
He hunted the Trojans, a lionous roar.  
With spear poised high and a heart made of flame,  
He turned every foe into whispers of shame.

Cycnus, son of Poseidon, proud and divine,  
Challenged Achilles in battle’s cruel design.  
Yet the swift-footed warrior, cunning and bold,  
With a rock he struck true, his story retold.

In Thebes and in Lyrnessus, his victories bloomed,  
With each city fallen, the Greek glory resumed.  
But in the depths of his heart, a shadow did grow,  
For war’s bitter toll was a weight he would know.

Yet through the darkness, he claimed his fair prize,  
The beauty of Briseis, like stars in the skies.  
The tales of his deeds echoed through every hall,  
For Achilles, the mightiest, would not fear the fall.

**Book XX: The Quarrel Begins**

At last, the Greeks took Chryseis as a prize,  
A maiden claimed beneath the Trojans’ eyes.  
Yet soon Apollo’s wrath was stirred to flame,  
For Chryses, her father, called upon his name.  
The god sent plague upon the Greeks that spread,  
And warriors fell by hundreds, sick and dead.  
Agamemnon, stubborn, slow to heed,  
Refused the plea to let the captive freed.  
At last the Greeks, led by Achilles' voice,  
Demanded he return her as their choice.

With scornful gaze, the Mycenaean king,  
Relented, but his pride cut deep its sting.  
"Since I must lose the girl to please the gods,  
I’ll take Briseis from Achilles' sods."  
Achilles’ face grew dark with rage untold,  
His honor struck, his pride grown fierce and bold.  
"You dare to take what I have rightly earned?  
Then all my might from war shall be adjourned!"

He left the camp, his Myrmidons in tow,  
Refusing now to let his anger go.  
Without Achilles, Greece would feel the cost,  
As war turned dark and hope seemed all but lost.

**Book XXI: The Greek's Struggles Without Achilles**

Now, leaderless, the Greeks fell back in fear,  
For Hector’s force pressed hard with spear and gear.  
The Trojans surged with strength renewed by pride,  
And many Greeks, their strength and will, denied.  
Agamemnon called his forces to stand,  
But Achilles’ absence left them weak and fanned.  
Odysseus and Ajax fought in vain,  
To hold the line, to stem the Trojan gain.

Patroclus, friend of Achilles, gazed in grief,  
He knew the Greeks had lost their greatest chief.  
Yet still he sought to mend the wound of pride,  
To bring Achilles back to Greece’s side.  
But all the while, Achilles sat withdrawn,  
His wrath unyielding as the breaking dawn.

The Trojan tide rose higher day by day,  
The Greek ships now in danger of dismay.  
Would Achilles return before the Greeks fell?  
Only fate and time had yet more to tell.

**Book XXII: The Contest for Achilles’ Glory**

In days of quiet, when the war did rest,  
The Greeks held contests, feats to prove the best.  
Though battles raged and men fell thick and fast,  
They sought to claim the glory of the past.  
Among them, warriors strong and bold would vie,  
To wear Achilles’ fame and touch the sky.

Ajax, tall as mountain, wide as sea,  
Declared, “There’s none as strong in arms as me.  
Without Achilles, I shall lead our charge,  
And wield the strength of gods both swift and large.”  
But Diomedes, fierce with fire’s gaze,  
Stepped forth and challenged Ajax to the blaze.

With spears and shields, the two men clashed as one,  
Beneath the watching gaze of every son.  
Their strikes were fierce, their shields like stars of light,  
As both men fought to prove their noble might.  
But though their hearts were full of warrior’s pride,  
The gods above refused to let them bide.

For though they fought, Achilles still remained,  
A shadow over all the glory gained.  
And so, though strength and courage they did show,  
No man could take Achilles’ place below.  
The contest, fierce and bold, had shown its strain,  
But none could win his fame upon the plain.

**Book XXIII: The Siege on the Beach**

The Trojans, fierce with courage newly fed,  
Now pressed upon the Greeks, who filled with dread.  
The sands of Ilium echoed with the sound,  
Of battle fierce as day turned slowly round.  
Upon the beach where Greek ships lined the shore,  
The Trojans sought to burn and win the war.

With Hector at the head, they pushed with might,  
And drove the Greeks before them in their flight.  
The ships, once proud, now vulnerable and weak,  
Became the target for the Trojans' streak.  
The Greeks, without Achilles’ wrathful sword,  
Fell back, their hope in danger of being floored.

Great Hector struck with fury, fierce and wide,  
His spear the harbinger of Troyan pride.  
The flames they sought to light upon the mast,  
Would signal Troy’s revenge for years now past.  
Yet Ajax stood, his shield a wall of force,  
To guard the ships from Hector’s mighty course.

His voice a beacon to the Greek’s despair,  
“Hold fast!” he cried, “Do not let Hector dare!  
For if our ships should burn, then all is lost,  
And all our years of war shall bear the cost.”  
His words, though strong, could barely stem the tide,  
For Hector’s strength grew greater still with pride.

The gods above watched on with stern concern,  
For neither side could claim the war’s full turn.  
Thus war raged on, with neither side ahead,  
And Ilium stood tall, though rivers bled.

**Book XXIV: Achilles Withdraws**

While Greeks and Trojans fought with savage will,  
Achilles sat apart, his heart grown still.  
The rage within him simmered, hard and cold,  
For Agamemnon’s slight had broken bold.  
Though Greeks were pressed, though ships were set aflame,  
Achilles would not rise, his pride the same.

Patroclus stood beside him, full of grief,  
And begged his friend to lend the Greeks relief.  
But Achilles, wrathful, held his sword at bay,  
For honor’s loss had turned his heart to clay.  
“I will not fight for Agamemnon’s gain,  
Let them fall, and Troy’s fires burn the plain.”

Thus while the Greeks were driven to their knees,  
Achilles brooded, deaf to all their pleas.  
The war dragged on, each battle fierce and long,  
But without Achilles, hope seemed weak and wrong.

**Book XXV: The Fracturing of Greek Unity**

As years passed on, the Greeks began to break,  
For war’s long course had bent their will to ache.  
Achilles, though a force of wrathful pride,  
Had left their cause, his heart no longer tied.  
And so the Greeks, without their strongest hand,  
Did falter in the harsh and foreign land.

Agamemnon, king, though wise in lead,  
Had often clashed with men whose hearts did bleed.  
Odysseus, ever calm and full of thought,  
Now questioned if their fight was all for naught.  
“Why must we linger here upon these shores,  
When Troy’s high walls refuse to yield our wars?”

Yet others, fierce in battle’s raging heat,  
Would not admit defeat, nor think retreat.  
Menelaus, still driven by his grief,  
Urged all to fight and bring Troy’s quick relief.  
But without Achilles, strife within them grew,  
And cracks appeared where once their hearts were true.

The war itself was tearing them apart,  
And Greek unity was a fragile heart.
